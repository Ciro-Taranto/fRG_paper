We have applied fRG flow equations to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using a form factor decomposition for the momentum arguments of the two-particle vertex, but maintaining intact all the frequency dependencies. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such an approximation level has been achieved in a fRG calculation for interacting lattice fermions.
Our results show that a complete treatment of the frequency dependence is not only possible, but also very important.

The complexity of the fully frequency dependent implementation is rewarded by the possibility of accessing and understanding the frequency structures arising in the flow.
We confirm that, in a flow without self-energy feedback, there exist regions of parameter space where the vertex shows a divergence in the charge channel, as already found in Ref.~\onlinecite{Husemann2012}.
We are able to identify a simple set of Feynman diagrams that give rise to the above-mentioned divergence, that are likely to generate unexpected singular features in the charge channel also in other theories that take into account both the frequency dependence of the vertex and the interplay of different fluctuation channels.\cite{Stepanov2016}
 
The proper treatment of the frequency dependence of the vertex allows for a calculation of the frequency dependent self-energy.
We observed that the feedback of the self-energy into the vertex flow plays an important role, also at the qualitative level, since it suppresses the divergence in the charge channel. 

Given the increasing importance of the frequency dependence as more correlated regimes are approached, our work paves the way for future developments of the fRG for correlated fermion systems.
At moderate coupling, like the one treated here, the combination of a frequency dependent vertex and self-energy feedback allows to revisit and improve previous results. At strong coupling, a non-perturbative starting point is needed. 
This is what is proposed in DMF$^2$RG,\cite{Taranto2014} where the flow starts from the DMFT solution for the vertex and the self-energy, which are both strongly frequency dependent. Therefore, consistently taking into account the frequency dependence is crucial to access strongly interacting fermion systems.
