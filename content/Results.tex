\subsection{Frequency dependence of Vertex}

\begin{itemize}

\item Forward scattering problem seen by Salmhofer

\item Show phase diagram, $\Lambda_{cri}$ vs $x=1-n$, with and without $\Sigma$ 
          (for differenct $t'$)
          
\item Self energy "solve" the problem of charge instability.

\item Suggestion: The charge problem exists also at van Hove filling where, according to the literature, 
           the $\Sigma$ has no effect when Karrasch approximation is taken into account.

\item  Colorplots: Mag and Charge channel

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Forward scattering problem}

\begin{itemize}

\item Introduce perpendicular ladder (PL) for charge.

\item Colorplot of charge in PL.

\item Discuss the role of the Bubble at $\boldsymbol{Q}=(0,0)$ and plot it as a function of $\nu$.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Self energy effects}

\begin{itemize}

\item With self energy feedback, we didn't find any charge instability problem for any parameters range studied.

\item Plot of the Fermi surface based patch scheme.

\item Plot of $\Sigma(i\omega)$ at $\boldsymbol{k}=(\pi,0)$, $\boldsymbol{k}=\boldsymbol{k}_{HS}$ and $\boldsymbol{k}=(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in frequency space.

\item Plot of $Z_{\boldsymbol{k}}$

\item Plot of occupation with and without $\Sigma$

\end{itemize}
