\subsection{Flow equations}

\begin{itemize} 
\item General consideration about functional renormalizaton group: 1PI, truncation, 
\item vertex: notation, momentum and energy conservation, spin. Spin symmetry 

\end{itemize}

In the following paragraph we will introduce the functional renormalization group in the implementation that we used, and we will clarify some notational issue about the vertex. 

Generally speaking, the fRG allows to use the renormalization group idea to approach functional integrals. 
This is done by endowing the non-interacting propagator with an additional dependence on a scale parameter $\Lambda$, which generates an exact functional flow equation with known initial conditions. 

We will apply this approach to the effective action, whose expansions into the fields generates the one-particle irreducible (1PI)  functions. By expanding the functional flow equation one obtains a hierarchy of flow equations for the 1PI functions, involving vertexes of arbitrarily  high orders. 
We will restrict ourselves to the level-two truncation by retaining only the two lowest nonvanishing orders in the expansion, i.e., we consider the flow of the (scale dependent) self-energy $\Sigma^\Lambda$ and of the two-particle 1PI vertex $V^\Lambda$, neglecting the effects of higher order vertexes. 
Hence our approach becomes perturbative, and sums up efficiently, although approximately, the so-called parquet-diagrams. 

\subparagraph*{Symmetry considerations} We use the energy and momentum conservation to fix one of the arguments of the arguments of the self energy and of the vertex. 
Furthermore we restrict ourselves to the spin-symmetric phase. 
Hence for the self-energy  we only need to consider one function depending on one frequency-momentum argument: 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma^\Lambda_{\sigma\sigma'}(k)=\Sigma(k)\delta_{\sigma,\sigma'}, 
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \{\uparrow, \downarrow\} $, and $k=(\nu,\mathbf{k})$, $\nu$ being a Matsubara frequency and $\mathbf{k}$ a momentum in the first Brillouin zone.
